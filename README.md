# Shiny-Hunter
This program automates the shiny hunting of random Pokemon.
Usally shiny hunting is a very long and time conssuming task, but that changes with the aid of this program.

# Program Explanation
This program uses OCR technology to automatically hunt shiny pokemon for you on the DeSuME (Nintendo Ds Emulator).


This is still very much, a work in progress.

Emulator used for Ds games

Make sure DeSmuME emulator controls are set to the following:

RIGHT:  D

B:      NumPad - 6

A:      NumPad - 2

 (these following steps could change in the future due to updates in the program)
  1) Open DeSmuMe emulator and load into Compatible game of choice, change controls as need be.
  2) Minimize the emulator screen so you have room for both the Shiny Hunter GUI and the emulator.
  3) Locate the route of the Pokemon you are attempting to shiny hunt
  4) Find any line of grass (e.g 2 x 1, 3 x 1, 4 x 1 ...and so on) that is blocked on both sides.
  5) Run through the grass until you find the Pokemon you are looking for.
  6) Open Shiny Hunter 3.0 Gui, adjust window so that the emulator screen is completely visible (nothing can be blocking the emulator screen)
  7) Enter the Pokemon's name
  8) Click the "Capture Rectangle Around Pokemon" button, select the area around the wanted Pokemon's name and press okay (is the rectangle does not capture the entire name do no continue, retry and capture the enitre name before pressing ok)
  9) Click the "Capture Pokemon's Non-Shiny color" button, (this gives you about 5 seconeds to hover the mouse over the wanted Pokemon to capture it's normal color hover the mouse over the area that you are sure changes in the Pokemon's shiny form)
  10) Repeat Step 9 for the "Capture Run Button From Battle" button, but for the Run button on the second screen of the ds emulator (within the Pokemon battle).
  11) Click the "Run Program" and watch your time being saved :).
