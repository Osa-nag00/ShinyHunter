# Shiny-Hunter
This program automates the shiny hunting of random Pokemon.

This is still very much, a work in progress.

# Intructions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure DeSmuME emulator controls are set to the following:

  Set the " A " button to " enter "

  Set the game soft reset button combo (START, SELCT, L, R) all " , "


Make sure Citra emulator controls are set to the following:

  Set the " A " button to " enter "

  Set the game " Restart Emulation " hotkey to " , "

  Set the " Continue/Pause Emulation " hotkey to " space "


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (these following steps could change in the future due to updates in the program)

  1) Stand in front of the shiny pokemon you intend to use the program on and save the game.
  2) Enter battle
  3) Minimize the emulator screen so you have room for both the Shiny Hunter GUI and the emulator. (DO NOT USE SECOND SCREEN, MAIN SCREEN ONLY)
  4) Make sure to click both buttons and follow the intructions in the program
  5) Finally clicked the run button and watch the program run, or don't that was the point of making it. 

(CURENTLY THERE IS NO WAY TO EXIT PROGRAM AFTER CLICKING RUN WITHOUT USING TASK MANAGER OR THE PROGRAM FINDING THE SHINY, WILL FIX IN LATER UPDATE)

# Compatible Pokemon Games & Generations

  From my testing this works on Gen 4(Plat, SS, HG), and Gen 6 (X & Y).
  
  It should also work with everything in between, possibly Gen 7 as well (has not be tested)
